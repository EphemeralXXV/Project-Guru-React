    description: "This pack includes all stages with over 1% gravel coverage turned into 99%+ tarmac tracks (excluding Clocaenog Mid and the snowy stages, as they are extremely difficult to work with due to the plethora of different surfaces, etc.; the latter will probably have to be reworked into a different environment as well). There is obviously still a ton of things to be fixed, mainly texture correcting, but in many cases also texture replacement remains to be done for pretty much everything aside from the roads.",

Well the only differences bettween this and gravel thing is just different wheels so why just don't use da normal asphalt wheels everywhere if they look the same almost",
