The points are awarded after each rally, based on the rally rank. The maximum number of points achievable in a single rally depends on the number of participants. For example, the best result out of 10 competitors will be rewarded with 10 points, and with each lower rank, the amount of points decreases by 1 (so the 2nd place will get 9 points, 3rd â€” 8 points, and so on).",
